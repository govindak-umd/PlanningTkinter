# PlanningTkinter

View planning on Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/A9lTAano/planningtkinter).

Search Algorithms implemented here so far :

 - Breadth First Search Algorithm
 - Depth First Search Algorithm
 - Dijkstra's Search Algorithm
 - A * Search Algorithm

## How to run the program

Make sure all the installations are complete. These include:

- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- Numpy

Once done, you can execute the programs in two different ways:

1) Run each path planning seperately.
   
2) Run the menu, which will allow you to choose which planning algorithm to run

Left click to set the start node. *Indicated in Red*
Right click to set the goal node. *Indicated in Green*
